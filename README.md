# Parser of .bbl files

This repo provides a python script to extract and print as plain text the
bibliography from a .bbl generated by BibTeX when compiling the bibliography for
a LaTeX document. This is very useful when journals ask for the bibliography in
txt format. The script also converts the text in LaTeX format to utf-8 so the
accents and special characters are well represented.

Currently, the script has only been tested with few bbl files so be sure you
always check its output. Suggestions for improving the tool are welcome so do
not hesitate in sending a pull request or open an issue.

# Usage

If you run the script adding the path to the .bbl file as argument:

```
python3 parse_bbl.py path/to/the/file.bbl
```

It will print the bibliography in the terminal with one item per line numerated as:

```
[1] First bibliography item.
[2] second bibliography item.
.
.
.
```

For more specific usages check you can use the `BibItem` and the `BblFile`
classes defined in the script (see their documentation for more information).

## Requirements

Python 3.6 or later is required. On the other hand, the conversion from LaTeX to
utf-8 is handled by the `pylatexenc` packages so make sure you have it
installed:

```
python3 -m pip install pylatexenc
```
